# bali-fonts

This repository contains the latest release of two [Balinese Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balinese_(Unicode_block)) fonts: Vimala and Pustaka. These fonts are copyright [Aditya Bayu Perdana](https://www.behance.net/byabay), all rights reserved. The fonts are available under the [CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). Aditya Bayu Perdana designed the glyphs. [PanLex](https://panlex.org) assisted in developing the OpenType rules.

Vimala has a similar style to Bali Simbar, a non-Unicode font designed by I Made Suatjana that is popular in Bali. Pustaka has a monoline (“sans-serif”) style that is optimized for screens. Below is a sample showing the Balinese greeting _om swastyastu_ in Vimala (above) and Pustaka(below):

PanLex has designed a [Keyman keyboard](https://keyman.com/keyboards/aksarabali_panlex) that can be used with these fonts or other Balinese Unicode fonts.
